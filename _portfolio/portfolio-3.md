This is a program I worked on when I was in the Project Team in the Codable RSO. 
It notifies the user when a new car deal with user-specified parameters appears on the website. It can send a desktop notification and records the most recent deal by generating a csv file. Within our team, I helped develop a function that scrapes the relevant information using the user input parameters, and a function that writes the scraped data into separate csv files.
