This logic processor is capable of performing 8 different 4-bit bitwise operations. It uses two 4-bit registers as storage for both inputs and outputs. This processor was implemented purely with hardware components only. By default it runs with a 1kHz clock, which can be slowed down to 1Hz to see the operation process happen bit-by-bit in real time on the LED strip. All functions are shown in the truth table below.

- Using provided truth table and function description to convert to logic expressions and finite state machine
- Exploring ways to simplify logic expression to minimize chip usage
- Unit testing each component before implementation
- Debugging circuit by unit testing different sections separately
