This logic processor is capable of performing 8 different 4-bit bitwise operations. It uses two 4-bit registers as storage for both inputs and outputs. This processor was implemented purely with hardware components only. By default it runs with a 1kHz clock, which can be slowed down to 1Hz to see the operation process on the LED strip.
