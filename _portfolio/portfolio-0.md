This is an ongoing project I have recently started working on. My endgoal is to make a robot arm that can track a specific object when it comes into range. 

Currently, I have a simple robot built using breadboards, an Arduino UNO R4 Minima, and a 9g micro servo. 
This robot uses a photoresistor to repeatedly scan its surroundings until it "sees" a position where the brightness level reaches a certain level. 
The next couple of milestones I am trying to reach within a week are: 
- Getting the Arduino to communicate with ROS topics using Python3
- Smoothing out servo motor movement
